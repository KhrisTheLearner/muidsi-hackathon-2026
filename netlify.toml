# AgriFlow — Netlify frontend deployment config
# Frontend is a static Vite/React build.
# Backend (FastAPI) runs separately on Hugging Face Spaces.
#
# Required env var (set in Netlify UI — NOT here):
#   VITE_API_URL = https://YOUR-USERNAME-agriflow.hf.space

# SPA fallback: all routes serve index.html
# (AgriFlow doesn't use React Router but this is best practice for SPAs)
