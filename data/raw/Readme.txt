Information Quality Guidelines
About Quality of Information
In compliance with the requirement of the USDA Information Quality Guidelines, this page provides information pertaining to requests for correction of information disseminated by NASS.

The USDA Information Quality Guidelines correction mechanisms are not intended to imply any rights of individuals to request amendments of their own records beyond those permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other organization specific laws.

Where to Submit a Formal Request for Correction
All requests for correction of NASS information must be submitted by letter, fax, or email to:

Quality Management Office

Information to be Submitted with a Request for Correction
To seek a correction of information, please submit a written request as follows:

State that your request for correction of information is submitted under Section 515 of Public Law 106-554 or under USDA's Information Quality Guidelines
Include your name, mailing address, fax number (or e-mail address), telephone number, and organizational affiliation, if any.
Clearly describe the information you believe to be in error and want corrected. Include the name of NASS’ publication, report or information product, the date of its issuance, and a detailed description of the information you feel should be corrected.
State in detail why you feel the information should be corrected and, if possible, recommend specifically how it should be corrected. Please clarify which USDA Information Quality Guidelines were not followed or were not sufficient. Provide documentary evidence, such as comparable data, which will help in our review.
Explain how you use the information and how you have been harmed by the alleged error.
We do not intend this guidance to be a set of legally binding requirements. However, we may be unable to meet your request in a timely fashion, or at all, if you omit one or more of these elements. We do not intend to imply that, as an individual, you have any rights to request amendment of your own records beyond those permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other organization specific laws.

Agency Review of Requests
Based on its review of the information you provide, NASS will:

Determine whether a correction is warranted and, if so, what action to take. The nature, influence, and timeliness of the information involved, the significance of the correction, and the magnitude of the effort will be considered in deciding the level of review and any corrective action.
Respond to you by letter, e-mail, or fax within 20 working days. Our response will explain the findings of the review and the actions we will take. If your request will require more than 20 working days to resolve, we will state the reason for the additional time and provide an estimated decision date.

Privacy Act Statement
USDA is authorized to obtain certain information under Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law No. 106-554, codified at 44 U.S.C. 3516, note). Information is needed by USDA to process the request for correction and allow USDA to reply accordingly. This information is needed by USDA to respond to the requestor and initiate follow-up contact with the requestor if required. Requestors should not send USDA their Social Security Number. Requestors are advised that they do not have to furnish the information but failure to do so may prevent their request from being processed. The information requestors furnish is almost never used for any purpose other than to process and respond to their request. However, USDA may disclose information to a congressional office in response to an inquiry made on behalf of the requestor, to the Department of Justice, a court, other tribunal when the information is relevant and necessary to litigation, or to a contractor or another Federal agency to help accomplish a function related to this process.

Peer Review
Based on the review it has conducted, NASS believes that it does not currently produce or sponsor the distribution of influential scientific information (including highly influential scientific assessments) within the definitions promulgated by OMB. As a result, at this time NASS has no agenda of forthcoming influential scientific disseminations to post on its website in accordance with OMB's Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review.
